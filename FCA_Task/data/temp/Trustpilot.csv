Polite and helpful assistance in navigating some complex issues. A measure of incompetence where the staff were at least well-meaning. Also, an occasion where a branch manager informed me that ""anyone can fake a passport"" and went on to scream at me because I was unable to reproduce my signature to his liking. Of late, Lloyds has bet the stables on the flimsy prefab that is Internet Banking, and has been closing down branches. Pity the poor customer who still deals in cash. I have turned-up at the Southend high-street branch on three occasions over the past year, or so, to find it closed, twice on account of COVID; once because it was a bit windy. One sympathises up to a point, but when every other bank and business on the same high-street is managing to work around these issues and remain open, one has to wonder about the management of this particular branch and the motivation of the staff. The solution offered in the laminated sign stuck up on the door is to make use of the Post Office - certainly no COVID there. This overlooks the fact that the Post Office in Southend is similarly understaffed - sometimes with only one person on the counter. I queued for 45 minutes the last time I went there. It strikes me as disingenuous of Lloyds to signpost their customers to an alternate service and consider the problem taken care of. The thing that I find most galling is that, when my local branch does close its doors unexpectedly, there is no way of knowing until I have walked 2 miles to find the door locked. They waste my time. They should be more proactive in alerting their customers to any changes in their opening hours. There is, at present, a gross misalignment between the syrupy claims, made by Lloyds Bank in its expensive-looking commercials, to be right by the side of its customers throughout their lives, and the spartan reality, in which the bank has assumed the role of an absent parent who has abandoned their responsibilities to make a go of becoming an Internet celebrity. I never thought the day would arrive when I would unload impotent torrents of foul language at the Lloyds Bank mascot whenever it made an appearance in a TV advert, and yet here we are. I am not sure where Lloyds is. Certainly not where I need them to be.","40"

My wife had an accident skiing and fractured her arm. I rang our crystal ski rep to ask for some help and advice on our journey home as we had a 4 hour train journey to the airport and 3 changes of trains. Our crystal rep (spoke very briefly to us at the airport) was totally uninterested and when I rang her, she already knew of my wife’s injury but didn’t contact us to ask if we were ok or required assistance , I was told that although it was our reps day off , she had to log the incident so would do it as her contract was finishing and she was heading home the same day as we were supposed to go home (at this stage I did not know if my wife required surgery and would need to stay in Switzerland for longer than our initial stay) . I was told that if we wanted assistance because of my wife’s injury, contact my insurance company. Crystal did not contact us to ask if my wife was well enough to travel home or if our insurance company was able to arrange transportation from our accommodation to the airport. I would not recommend travel with this company again as we had no back up at all in the case of an emergency. Update, We are safely home with the help of our insurance company (NFU Mutual who have been excellent with their help) with no help at all from crystal ski holidays, as far as Crystal Ski are aware, my wife could be having surgery for her arm and still in hospital!! We booked through this company to have some back up if we did have a problem or issue but unfortunately when we needed them, they didn’t want to know so I definitely can not recommend this company.","20"

Used compare the market to get quote comparisons. Run the quote 3 times over a period of 4 days. Each time, Hastings Direct came back with a competitive quote of £259. However, on choosing to proceed with the quote and being transferred to their website, suddenly the price jumps by over 20% to £312, with no changes and no explanation. Used their online chat to ask why and the agent responded that they 'use real time pricing', so the premium can change from what's shown on the comparison site. However, I re-ran the quote again on Compare the Market and yet again, it returned Hastings Direct with a premium of £259 - so 4 times in less than a week the same premium quoted. Obviously artificially low premium shown on the comparison site to tempt you, but they clearly have no intention of honouring the premium shown. Appalling business practice in my opinion.","20"

ENTER AT YOUR OWN PERIL....YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!!!!","I totally agree with everyone's complaints before me. There's not much more I can add to the reviews that's not been said previous. My story briefly. Exhaust was stolen. Took a week to collect van. Then the courtesy van was not like for like eg my jumbo transit to a combo hire van. So I had to cancel scheduled work. I found out that my van was at the wrong repair garage for 3wks waiting for it to be collected & taken to the correct repair shop, & it was me who tracked it down & arrange the collection. Nobody from the garage or I could get hold of Markerstudy to sort. Then I had to pay the VAT of the cost of the works. Yes, I could claim it back but I had no work for over 4wks. No work, no money. Then they charged me for cancelling my insurance. Inbetween all this, I was on hold for hours & hours.... then cut off.......or told to call another number. Keep away, enter at your own peril. They may be cheaper than most. But this is certainly the old 'you get what you pay for' phrase. Total embarrassment from start to finish.","20"

On Monday I was contacted by Vizion Network who were handling the claim. I confirmed that I would need a courtesy car. On Tuesday Vizion Network called for photos of my car. I was told that the garage would arrange a courtesy car. Thursday the garage called. They arranged to collect my car that day. I was told they didn't supply courtesy cars as they had a contract with Enterprise and they would be in touch. I didn't hear from Enterprise on Friday so called the garage. I was advised to call Hastings Direct to get a courtesy car. They put me through to Vizion Network who told me to speak with the garage. I kept getting passed to each different company and no one took any responsibility. At 4.30pm on Friday Hastings Direct said I would not get a courtesy car as there was a shortage. I had plans to travel to Devon very early Saturday and this was not what I wanted to hear. No one suggested that if I could get a car they would reimburse me. Why was I not told about the issue when I made my claim? I specifically took out an insurance policy with a courtesy car included but the insurance company did not honour this. I am seeking compensation for all the stress I experienced and spending all day calling up the three companies involved.","20"

I wanted to change my insurance to a new car. This couldn't be a simple switch and they had to requote. And WOW. What a price hike. They quoted me over £1,100 for annual insurance. My previous premium with Swinton was £320. I was moving to an electric car, same manufacturer and a smaller model. Despite my protests, the call handler said it was the best price. I have over 10 years no-claims and am a 'mature' driver. I've never paid that much for insurance in my life. The call handler who gave me this quote was very painful to deal with, snappy and didn't seem to know the product. So I went off and found other insurance which was £800 cheaper than this quote. When I subsequently called back to cancel, that call handler did not seem to know the process at all, so much so I gave him the benefit of the doubt as I thought he may have started work today.

Faith restored� Hearing customers when legitimate complaints arise is a prized quality from an insurer!","*EDIT* as a result of lodging a complaint, Michelle called and rectified everything and left me convinced my experience was a bizarre event in no way indicative of 1stCentral's culture. Hence 1star is now 5star. Be prepared to be ambushed mid-policy by requests for information they already have and know that you can't possibly get, or your policy is effectively invalid unless you pay them more, and therefore the policy never was valid from the outset (try claiming in that situation).. After being asked well into the policy to provide my 25yrs NCB, I subsequently managed to get one of them to admit that nothing after 9+ years even affects one's premium in any case! (another way to rip us off) The cooling off period after taking out a policy is 14days, but First central started sending emails a month later telling me I had to pay over twice the agreed fee for the policy unless I could produce evidence of my 25years no claims. No insurance company with decent customer service would make us just through that hoop. Anybody who has made claims will tell you, the insurance companies know about it, and they know when you haven't had accidents, claims or ""tips"" from the Police. This is why most car insurance companies don't perform the charade of asking for NCBs. There's literally no point. They have the information. Or they all do except 1st Central if manager Lee is to be believed, and we ignore that the system he says ""tips"" them off is exactly the information he is claiming they don't have so vehemently. It gets worse, as I understandably wanted to cancel my policy (which had clearly been worthless from the start, in practice unclaimable anyway) 1st Central want to charge us over £200 for only a month's phoney cover if I cancel. First I spoke to Akhona, who was clearly amused at how absurd the new fee was. I appreciated that humour because it was obviously nuts even by 1st Central's standards. Our £300+ policy became £600+ unless we provide proof of 25 years No claims. Remember this contact came fully two weeks after the policies cooling off period ended! Please Note that Manager Lee Campbell says that everybody has to pay a large admin fee to cancel even within their cooling off period. Not a cooling off period then, is it? So once told by Akhona that she had no power to sort the daft situation, I asked kindly if I could speak to somebody who could do something to correct things. Enter Manager Lee Campbell. Navigating the mantras of denial (fully half the call was him explaining that I couldn't cut in and interrupt him, somewhat ironically), it readily became apparent that he would brickwall any idea that 1st Central was at fault for the crazy fees or moving the goalposts far outside of the cooling off period, nor excepting that poor admin and service granted us every right to cancel without paying their huge unjustified fees. 1st Central's fees by the way are exorbitant, in this case over £230 with just £94 of our annual premium being returned to us for just a month of cover which was void anyway according to their new stipulations. I've lodged formal complaints with their Complaints department, which for some reason ""isn't customer facing"", but best believe we are now looking at the legal options to recover our money. We're also planning to be extremely active in spreading our awful experience with 1st Central far and wide. Don't be fooled by the good reviews here, they've clearly just paid up and not had to claim or deal with them ♂️ All we want to do is cancel and go to an insurer that will just get on with it without the BS, but 1st Central wants to charge us nearly a full year's fee just to cancel after a month because their service is clearly poor next to Esure, Privilege, swift, Octopus, Admiral, Aviva.. you name them, we've been with them and they were all better than 1st Central, not once springing this sort of scam outside of their cooling off periods. If I had known I had to muck about chasing previous insurers (who can't be arsed to dig out NCBs), I'd have cancelled immediately and dealt with another insurer. Bottom line, you cannot cancel your policy with 1st Central, whatever they get up to, without being slapped with enormous fees that even their managers struggle to explain or account for. Maybe I just got a bad egg on the phone, but given this experience I recommend anyone to avoid insuring with 1st Central like the plague. Please give this review a thumbs up if you found it useful, I don't want anyone else out there to get an email on their Bday demanding an additional sum of money greater than the original annual payment! To be clear, we are customers in our forties who've never claimed on car insurance in our lives and declared everything correctly for the policy.","100"

My car got taken and when I then enquired about my hire car I was told I could only have one for the one day they were working on my car. In about a months time!

I telephoned Esure to cancel the policy and was told that I would receive £32.86 refund in a couple of days. Given that I paid £150 for twelve months insurance and I had used less than five months of it, I queried how this could be? The representative explained that Esure charge a £60!!! Administration fee for cancelling your policy. Sixty pounds for pressing a key on a computer keyboard? The representative cancelled the policy whilst I was on the phone, it took seconds and I was paying for the phonecall for him to do so, too! How can any company justify a sixty pound charge for pressing one button on a keyboard? It is simply extortion and Esure should be embarrassed to behave in such a manner. It will lose them custom certainly mine, as I will never insure with them again. Furthermore I will ensure that as many people as possible are made aware of their unfair and unscrupulous policy, so that friends and family don't fall foul of their objectional and unjustifiable tactics to rip off customers, in order to boost their profits. Please avoid avoid avoid! Forewarned is forearmed! Until customers vote with their feet, unscrupulous insurance companies like Esure will continue to use these immoral practices. Response to your reply Just because you have a policy of making exorbitant charges for simple clerical adjustments to online documents or cancelling policies, doesn't mean that that policy is ethical or fair. As to the FCA having to oversee and approve your policies, just how independent are the FCA when as a regulatory body, it is funded by the very organisations it is regulating?

NFU sent out renewal invitation for our three vehicles on 14th February (Royal Mail postmark 14th Feb but invitation dated 9th January!) which was a couple of days after we went on our six week annual holiday to get away from the British winter. On our return this week there was a letter telling us that our policy was cancelled because it had not been renewed by the renewal date of 12th March. This means that our daughter has been driving around for 11 days without any insurance and we drove back from Heathrow with no insurance. This is quite a frightening thought when you consider what might have happened if there was an accident. I immediately contacted NFU in Stratford who were very apologetic and understanding and said that it was very common for renewal invitations not to be posted for several weeks after printing. But they said that because the policy had lapsed by ten days they would have to re-quote and would not honour either the renewal price of £1346.06 or the Mutual bonus. They then rang me back with the re-quote and put the price up to £2239.98. An increase of 66%. No change in risk. No change of vehicles. No change in circumstances. An extra £893. WHY? No explanation of any sort beyond a statement to say that rates change on a daily basis. Up 66% in a little over a week. I think it is scandalous and for them to not offer any explanation is quite extraordinary and extremely unfair. There can be no justification. We were not negligent and it was not our fault. We have now had to go to another insurer. And inevitably saved a lot of money even compared to the original NFU renewal quotation. So we are financially better off but that is not the point. We would have preferred to pay the extra and stay with the NFU who we thought we knew and trusted. NOT ANY MORE!","20"

As the victim of poor road condition (windscreen), A careless third party driver and an act of pure vandalism, it seems truly unfair that I and others in similar circumstances are punished with higher premiums. Where is the Justice in this ?","60"

We both thought that One Call Insurance would come to our rescue. Sadly, it was not to be. U Drive Cover came out top for price on comparethemarket.com. Second on the list was One Call Insurance who secured our business as we were assured the price quoted was the price to be paid (which wasn’t true with U Drive Cover). Fully comprehensive cover for just under £750, happy days! Unfortunately, the vehicle my daughter had bought had to be returned for a full refund. Shortly after, we found and purchased an older (by two years), cheaper (by 20%) version of the same car. You’d think there wouldn’t be much cost to swap the new vehicle onto the policy, right? You’d be wrong; can you believe One Call asked for an additional premium of £981 on top of the £750 already paid? We didn’t, so, left with no choice, replacement cover had to be found elsewhere at a sensible price at very short notice. Hastings Direct to the rescue with a premium of around £850. When asked for an explanation, One Call could only talk about ‘fluctuating prices’, what, to that degree? Absolute rubbish. To pour salt on the wound, the 17 days of cover with One Call cost my daughter £107 which included a cancellation charge of £55.99 which we believe should have been waived as they put us in a very difficult position where we couldn't proceed. Before the change of vehicle experience, One Call would have got a 5 star review, mainly for rescuing us from the clutches of U Drove Cover Ltd, however, with what happened subsequently, I’d like to take all their stars away, unfortunately I can’t. Sometimes a good price from a supposed decent company still doesn’t work out well.","20"

I have a policy with Hastings, and unfortunately had an accident in January of this year. I sent over dashcam footage and logged the claim immediately without having to be asked as I just wanted to get everything sorted. I had no contact made with me at all from Hastings, no one to talk me through the steps or what was going on. I was contacted by the car repairers and the courtesy car provider, after a week of having the courtesy car the company demanded I return it without me having my car back (Which is why I paid for a courtesy car, to have it whilst I was without mine.) Hastings refused to pay for me to extend the time I could have the courtesy car and I was told by one of their advisors on the phone that as me and the girl I had the accident with were both insured by them I would have a tricky time with this claim as it looses Hastings money. Fast forward 3 months - after calling every week for an update and to see what was going on with my claim I have been told repeatedly that my dashcam footage has still not been viewed. I sent this in on the 28th January!!! - The advisors on the phone viewed the footage whilst on the phone to me etc.. and kept saying we will pass this on to the 'file handler' Please also note that the girl who I had the accident with who is also insured with Hastings never reported the incident. Although it clearly says in the policy - insurance is void if you fail to report an incident - I was told this several times on the phone that she had not reported it, and they were chasing her which is why it was taking so long to settle the claim. I then receive an email to say the claim has now been closed - so I call Hastings to be told I am being dealt with by a very 'specific and special' department. Probably because both parties are insured with Hastings and it's their way of making a bias decision to save themselves money. I was unhappy with the outcome of this claim, and asked for someone to talk me through how they reached this decision. I did question - 'Had he even watched the dashcam footage that clearly showed what happened' - I then asked for the legal protection that I had paid extra for when taking out my policy, only to be told that if I had wanted to use this I needed to say so when I was contacted when I made the claim. - As above no one ever contacted me. So to summarize - It took hasting's 3 months to view the dashcam footage, they even 'requested' it although they already had it on file. I paid for legal protection that I'm not able to use. As both parties are insured with Hasting's they refuse to pay out, and have made a bias decision to save themselves money. Trying to contact them - well you have more luck getting blood out of a stone. Being told multiple different things from different advisors on the phone - Unhelpful customer service teams. AVOID this insurance at all costs - you may make savings at first but they will SCAM you out of much more than you have saved if god forbid you get into an accident. REPLY TO HASTINGS…. My complaint wasn’t the time frame in which the claim was settled. It was the false information I was told on the phone regarding footage being viewed and someone getting back in contact. The fact that the other party never reported the incident, so why was her insurance not void… The legal cover the phone number you provided was for an ‘advice’ line which was no help. I have now sought my own legal cover and am taking action in due course. I have proof this claim was settled biasly in order to ensure Hastings does not have to pay out. As for the generic replies hasting provide… STILL AVOID this company is crap !","20"

I went with the free excess cover with go compare and when someone drove into my car, leaving me with £345 excess to pay , they would not help! It feels to me like they never had any intention of paying the £250 excess that was the reason i went through them, they have made me literally jump through hoops to make a claim, and even Hastings direct have not been able to believe the things they have asked me to provide, in order to make a claim. Eventually they have told me i will only be paid out if i can prove not at fault, even though i am not at fault the driver drove off so it has now gone to court! I have sent them every letter i have had from my insurance but no joy. I will never go through Go Compare again !","20"

I was initially told somebody would be with me in an hour and a half. It’s now five hours and counting. This was bundled into an insurance deal. All I’m going to say is I need to make sure this never happens again. In the future I will get a separate breakdown cover from my insurance so I never have to go with a RAC again. Customer Service seemed surprised when I told them you get much better service from other providers.","20"
