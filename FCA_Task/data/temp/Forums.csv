Eventually got the car back, but it went back a few more times due to poor quality repair work and incorrect/incomplete parts fitment (i.e. wrong size wheel with incorrectly-sized tyre; non-functional handbrake as they'd not connected it back up; damaged diff not replaced; misaligned gearbox not fixed, etc.). After finally getting these 'snags' fixed - which I was then told took it well over the write-off threshold (not my fault that they'd decided to ignore stuff so they'd get the work), come next service we found a few other little cut-corners like sticking the brake sensor socket behind difficult-to-access bolted-on bodywork instead of in the easy-to-access wheel arch.

You may get one that will accept a debit card. At some point you'll need to modernise your school a bit! Car hire excesses can be quite high these days and you will need to cover them somehow - either with the hirer's own expensive cover or get a cheap cover elsewhere. If not you cover the risk yourself (long story). When you put up a credit card, it doesn't impinge on your own bank account and if someone puts a charge on - justified or not (most people don't understand excesses) - then you either either claim it back if unjustified or at worst it isn't coming out of your bank. Get another card, just use it for holiday purposes, it also improves your credit rating. Just read the first reply - yes, those companies you can use their own insurance. Another way is to take out insurance4carhire (an annual or one trip policy) Rule number 1 - never use Goldcar.","neutral","Not available"

Once the engine warmed up and went up another hill and it seemed fine. I'm guessing the gearbox is on its way out and just hoping it will last until I can sell it off as I have no money left to repair it. like I say the car drives fine once it's warm and drives beautifully actually. one other weird thing is that the EML doesn't come on, at all... either it's been mapped out or maybe it's not common? the guy I bought it off has now blocked me and I've later found out used a fake profile on Facebook..... feel like I've been scammed. I obviously can't take the car back and not sure if i can do anything legally about it. Any ideas on what I should do? I was thinking take AA insurance out for the gearbox and maybe taking it to a gearbox specialist to have a look? Has anyone had similar issues? Many thanks guys","neutral","United Kingdom"

Got the car in December 2021, loving it. Yesterday morning the roof of next door’s house fell off in the storm, bits of it landing on my car. Damage is a smashed roof, dented near side rear wheel arch, massive scratch on the boot and some lighter scratching on the offside rear. Other bits of the roof went through my house roof just to add to the frustration factor and another insurance claim. I’m with esure and they have been completely unhelpful. Went from “you need to fix it yourself and come to an arrangement with the neighbour” to “we can pick it up, take it to a compound (open air, big hole in roof…) and take it to our bodyshop, which isn’t Tesla approved on Monday. Anyone got any ideas for what I should be doing? The neighbours have raised a home insurance claim and given me their insurer and claim number - but my big issue is the car is leased from Tesla so can just “any” garage fix it or does Tesla only support and work with their approved body shops? If I insist on an Tesla approved bodyshop (a mile from the house) it’s an extra £200 on the excess and no hire car in the meantime. If I could with esure’s bodyshop is the work from a non-Tesla approved place, going to be a) good and b) ok for the lease? And will this be a long exercise as most Tesla bodyshop repairs seem to be if you Google it…? It’s 6:40am, I’m lying in bed trying to work it all out in my head .

Toerags know that the cost of incarceration is prohibitive (even if you get get the boys in blue to get the toerag into the dock), and fines are ineffectual. Zero legal concerns to put the scumbags off robbing. The only thing that would put most toerags off is the potential of being caught and then ""sorted out"" good & proper by the owner of the property. However, you can guarantee that the disinterested Police & Courts are suddenly on the case the moment any toerag has been caught by an owner and has received some ""Aversion Therapy"" from said owner (but of course only to punish the owner, and to stick their hand deep into his pocket to add insult to toerag injury and exploit the situation). It's all messed up. The Law needs to be that assets of the toerags are seized to cover the costs if apprehending the lowlife, and to provide retribution to the owner for their losses - not as now which seems is The Law doing nothing ir just adding another kick in the nuts to the injured party.","neutral","United Kingdom"

My understanding is that the pre delivery number plates won't be linked to the DVLA database at the time of issue preventing auto population of the car details on Insurer's databases. Cars are not normally registered with the DVLA until 24-48 hours before delivery. However, as you have discovered, you can obtain a quote from an insurer by just enter the car details manually which remains active for around 30 days. You should be able to follow through by bringing up the quote, enter the reg and activate the insurance either via website or phone. This may have to be done nearer the time of collection. So this being my first Electric car and and also first Tesla I am shocked.

After looking at a few locally, and learning first hand what the dreaded failing Vanos noise sounded like, I came across an advert for a decent sounding car, but it was in Shropshire. After talking to the owner, there was nothing untoward so I arranged for an RAC inspection on it as a basic insurance against agreeing to buy a car with an obvious fault like a failing gearbox, oil leaks, corrosion or suspension issues. That came back with a clean bill of health, so off I went on a 3 train journey to a tiny station in Shropshire to buy the car and pick it up. I'd never actually seen an Atlantis Blue car before, and fortunately I really liked it. It was a rare colour on the E36, but it suited it well. The E36 as a model was rather unloved at the time, and parts of the interior were certainly a bit shonky compared to later generations, but I loved this car. It looked great, it was really fast compared to anything I'd had up until then, it was fairly small, and fun to drive. No driver aids apart from ABS, so you relied on the long travel analogue throttle to avoid getting into trouble. I had this for two or three enjoyable years, and over that time there was just one issue that really started to grate with me (literally). The car had a sunroof, and as a tall person, the top of my head used to brush the headlining unless I adopted a slight slouch. So eventually that was the reason to double my investment and get an E46. The car is actually still on the road as far as I know, a subsequent owner transplanted an S54 engine into it, plus lots of other things. I'd still have it original for preference, but at least he's looked after it. https://www.instagram.com/atlantis_s54/?hl=en","neutral","United Kingdom"

On the registration/insurance issue you will need to check carefully with the German dealer that they are aware of the post Brexit arrangements. You will need German ""export"" plates which should cover the van (almost invariably for third party only risks) within Germany and the EU. This will involve the temporary registration of the vehicle in Germany You should also receive a document that confirms you as the legal owner. In Germany the registration plates belong to the owner, and not to the vehicle, so that when vehicles are traded the plates are removed by the owner and transferred to their new vehicle. Hence the need for the declaration of ownership. I believe that since Brexit the insurance accompanying those plates may no longer be valid in UK. Don't be swayed by the advice that the temporary German plates should be removed before driving on UK roads. A LHD German van with German plates is not remarkable: the same van with no plates at all is, and would be highly likely to attract the attention of the police! I was told by the dealer selling my van (also co-incidently a La Strada) that the German export plates would only cover me up to the French channel port and would explicitly not cover me in the UK. Safeguard Insurance would insure on a VIN but only from a single point to point, i.e. from the UK channel port to either my home OR the garage undertaking the conversion work. They would not insure from Channel Port --> Home ---> Garage undertaking work. A garage invoice is required with the VAT registered address of the business and their VAT number. It must list the work undertaken and that if I recall correctly OEM parts have been used. (not cheap for 2020 Ducato lights) I don't think the vehicle has to be presented for a VOSA inspection if a VAT registered MOT certified garage undertakes the work. You simply need their invoice showing their VAT number and that the work has been completed using certified OEM parts. In my case the garage were handling the paperwork and so sent it in for me.for I think, given the complications, investigating the costs of outsourcing the transportation and/or conversion and/or paperwork may be worthwhile. They are not insignificant. However I suspect the import tax may be a bigger issue. This was not something that I needed to consider since I managed it all by July 2020, within the extended Brexit Transition period. Do please update as more information becomes available. The combination of transport or insurance, outsourced conversion work (or garage certification if you do it yourself) , paperwork (if you outsource it) and import duty may finally make importing from Europe no longer a viable option if the objective is to save money. I did it mainly because I had settled on a van that was significantly more expensive than most Panel Van Conversions (PVC) because of its build quality, configuration, and customisation options, and was not sold in the UK. So I was prepared to come out about flat or pay a small premium compared to buying a similarly high specced PVC in the UK. The exchange rate now is probably marginally better than when I purchased mine, but of course, a shadow of it's pre-Brexit position. Sadly there was, when I imported, no La Strada dealership in the UK and as far as I know there is not now. It's not a decision I regret. I have completed 14k miles mostly in Europe in 20 months, during COVID, and I'm off for five weeks next week. The van has been great so far - (fingers crossed) Edited by slowdriver 2022-01-27 8:36 AM","neutral","United Kingdom"

If one policy you are happy with is £500 but has an admin fee of £25 it would be likely better for you to go with that than a policy costing £600 without fees. This said it may be worth getting quotes for both your current car and new one and seeking providers who appear towards the cheaper end for both, accounting for their relative fees if you wish. Otherwise if you focus just on the current car you may find the premium change when swapping is high (hint: it’s not a ruse trap blah blah).","neutral","United Kingdom"

I feel like I am having to understand the insurance process, myself, to make sure I received what is fair to me. As it is ongoing and not complete yet, a part of this post is seeking formal/legal guidance to ensure we received what I am entitled too. Your help will greatly help and reduce the stress I am suffering this through this. My car: 2007 Toyota Auris, 1.6l, 95k mileage, vgc cosmetically and mechanically, owned since new. Last Friday (21/01/22), a council rubbish collection truck reverse into my car that was parked stationary on the road, no one was inside my car at the time. I saw the incident and rushed outside. The council driver of the truck apologised and accepted 100% liability. His provided his details and said to ring the council on the number he provided. Not sure of the correct process for this, whether to bypass my insurer and go direct to the council, I decided to ring my insurance company (Geoffrey insurance, underwritten by Zentih) and inform them of the incident. I informed them I was witness to the incident and provided them with the details the council driver gave me. They asked if I wanted to claim (I thought 'well, of course, yeah') I said yes as I wanted my car repaired. I provided details of what happened and they asked what visible damage there was. I advised the front bumper and front left headlight casement was damaged and needed replacing. I also advised the car was shunted back two (2) yards by the council truck. My insurance company agent said they would arrange for the car to be collected to have the damaged assessed. I thought this is normal/standard insurance claim practice and said 'okay'. She then proceeded with a speech (sphill as I call it informally) - I cannot remember what she said word for word but nothing alarmed me other than if I cancel the claim any temporary courtesy car will be invoiced to me. It all sounded standard practice and went with her guidance. A courtesy car was arranged and delivered later that day (Enterprise is the courtesy car company). The agent arrange for the car to be collected, by the company Copart, for the car to be assessed. I am not an insurance expert but the process sounded like normal practice. On Tuesday (18/01/22), the Copart collection driver came and informally advised, due to its age, the car will be written off and I should not to see it again. Panic came across me as I thought it was simply being collected to be assessed. The driver said the car has to be assessed so was he okay to take it away for that reason - I thought well if this is what the insurance has arranged then I guess it is a hoop I have to jump through. Copart took it away. At this point I was stressing thinking 'any damaged should be paid for by the council as there driver has accepted 100% liability so why is there a chance it will be written off?'. I phoned my insurer and said the car had been taken to be assessed. I made it clear to them I do not want my car destroyed and that I wanted it repaired. The agent said to phone Copart and explain this. I then rang Copart and explained this in which Copart's agent said that only collect the car for assessment, and that Independent Management Solutions (www.imsolutionslimited.co.uk/) will be the company assessing it. I then rang IMS and explained my predicament. I spoke to an assessor at IMS, not sure if would be the assessor, but he explained if the repair is more than the car's worth then it will be written-off. I said I don't want to written-off and that I want it repaired at the cost of the council. I said replacements were around �3k so if it's not fixed then I would need a �3k payout. He said, informally as it hasn't been assessed yet, that it was worth around �1k. I'm freaking out at this point as I'm thinking I'm going to be �2k out of pocked to replace my car with a like-for-like (Make, Model, Engine, Mileage, Cond, etc..) car that is within 50 miles of me. The assessor didn't seem concerned about my feelings. Still on the Tuesday (18/01/22), I phone my insurer again and spoke to another (different) agent and got different information. Frustration was high and I informed my insurance agent that I do not understand the vehicle insurance industry and that I need my insurance company to advise me correctly. I said I do not think they are informing me correctly. It seem each agent didn't understand the process/rules. She then went and spoke to her manager and reported back that the assessor will most probably write if off and give it a category ID and then will go to the council insurance company. I didn't know what to believe. I had had enough for that day as I was too stressed. On Wednesday (19/01/22), I rang my insurance company again and was put through to a manager of the Post-Claim department at Enterprise (it seems Enterprise is not only the courtesy car provider but also are involved in the insurance arena too). The manager seemed to know what she was talking about and said, in short, we need to the assessors report before the next step can happen - whether that would be a payout, buy-back, etc.. I'm totally stressed. At this moment I have a very strong suspicion, from all I've heard, that my car will be written-off and I will be awarded only �1k as that's what the Parkers guide quotes at. Having looked further I would need �2.6 to replace my car with an equivalent. My feeling is that I would either like my car repaired to the condition as it was before council truck driver reversed into it, or be awarded �2.6k which is the amount it would, I've now seen, cost to buy an equivalent car as per online prices show. I feel my insurance company have not been transparent with me, neither guided me, which I feel they should and understand their customer (me) will not understand the full process. I do not see why I should be at a financial loss if the assessor deems my car to be valued at �1k (due to a little book) when it is clear that online prices are around �2.6k. I can even prove this evidence. Bear in mind, the accident is due to the third-party in which they have accepted full liability. Please guide me and help my understand my rights as the assessor or my insurance company haven't been helpful. 1) Am I in my rights to refuse any payout offer unless it is the �2.6k so that I can purchase an equivalent car? 2) Can I request (enforce) my car to be repaired, regardless of the cost, the at the council's expense? 3) Do anyone know of the next step should I decline the payout offer? 4) I have 'Motor Legal Protection' on my policy, but was told by the insurance agent I couldn't use it to seek the car to be repaired or use it to received a proper payout, is this MLP something that can be used as legal aid? 5) Can I advise the assessor/insurance company to find me an equivalent car and I'll accept that as a replacement rather than a payout, maybe actually assign them a car to buy for me as the replacement? 6) I'm pretty sure my next premium will be increased due to this non-fault claim, I have read this online. Is there anyway I can seek compensation to cover the next year, or two, rises in insurance premium? 7) Is there anything else I should be aware of, or an action to take, for my advantage? Please can someone help me as I cannot afford to be without a car and neither can I afford (nor should I) additional money to replace the car. None of this is my fault so why should be at a financial loss. I need to understand my rights so not to be pushed over (fobbed off). Thank you in advance.","neutral","United Kingdom"

The solution came from the bro in law...'did you turn your wheels into the curb when you parked up?' 'Yes' - 'Is one tight up on the kerb?' It proved to be 'Yes' - 'Your wheel is putting pressure on the locking system. Turn in the direction of the wheel and you may have to force it hard over, ignition key in...' And it worked.....the service manager of my dealer hadn't heard of this and 'Thanks for this tip,' In short, try all the advice offered - in my case £150 call out fee avoided.","neutral","United Kingdom"

It’d be nice to get a 22 plate but if I’m keeping the car for 5 years or so, doubt the 22 plate will make any serious difference on resale; It’s still a 22 model. Anyone have any luck with MY insurance yet? I clicked on the Tesla Insurance link (Swinton) and you can’t even select Model Y from the drop down menu ! Also; I ordered the car, I’m paying for the car, I’m registering it in my wife’s name, she can’t make the pick up. Is it a problem for me to go collect the car instead? Any help appreciated. Thanks.","neutral","Not available"
